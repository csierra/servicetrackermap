Service Tracker Map
===================

This package provides a Service Tracker with a map interface. This should be useful when you need to track services of the same class but you need to aggregate them using some other criteria as an index, such as service properties or other data. This service tracker allows to track only one service per key or a list of them. In each case preserving the "service.ranking" semantics expected from a Service Tracker.
